# Foraged and Found 

This was a 7 day group project that we did for the final project during Dev Accademys bootcamp. A group size of 7. 

I was the product owner for this project which involved team leadership, explaining my idea and plan, keeping on track with the plan and team motivation.
Below is the information we wrote up as the brief for team members to refer to. We used Agile techniques such as stand-ups, kanban boards and sprints (a day or 2 at a time).

The outcome is an app where people can find other peoples foraging spots and information about them, save their own foraging spots which can be kept private if one so desires. 
One of the parts of this project I worked on was the filter section (sorting things either by category, oldest, newest or season) which used the full stack - database to components

This is a project which I will be continuing to add features to. I would love to hear any feedback and thoughts you might have to improve this.

## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
